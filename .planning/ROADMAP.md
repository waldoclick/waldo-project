- [x] **Phase 10: Price Utilities** - Create `app/utils/price.ts` and replace all 13 inline currency formatting definitions

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.4 URL Localization (Phases 12-15) — SHIPPED 2026-03-06</summary>

## v1.5 Ad Credit Refund

**Milestone Goal:** When an ad is rejected or banned, return the ad reservation and featured reservation credits to the user, and notify them via email that their credits were refunded.

### Phases

- [x] **Phase 16: Credit Refund Logic** — Wire credit return into `rejectAd()` and `bannedAd()` in Strapi (completed 2026-03-06)
- [x] **Phase 17: Email Notification Update** — Update `ad-rejected.mjml` and `ad-banned.mjml` to include conditional credit-returned messaging (completed 2026-03-06)

### Phase Details

#### Phase 16: Credit Refund Logic
**Goal**: When an ad is rejected or banned, its associated reservations are immediately freed for reuse
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.5)
**Requirements**: REFUND-01, REFUND-02, REFUND-03, REFUND-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Rejecting an ad with an `ad_reservation` causes that reservation's `ad` field to become `null` in the database
  2. Rejecting an ad with an `ad_featured_reservation` causes that reservation's `ad` field to become `null` in the database
  3. Banning an ad with an `ad_reservation` causes that reservation's `ad` field to become `null` in the database
  4. Banning an ad with an `ad_featured_reservation` causes that reservation's `ad` field to become `null` in the database
  5. Reservations freed by reject/ban are immediately reusable by new ads (no orphan state)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — Wire reservation-freeing into rejectAd() and bannedAd()

#### Phase 17: Email Notification Update
**Goal**: Users receive clear confirmation in reject/ban emails that their credits were refunded
**Depends on**: Phase 16 (refund flags `adReservationReturned` / `featuredReservationReturned` set in service layer)
**Requirements**: EMAIL-01, EMAIL-02, EMAIL-03, EMAIL-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Reject email sent for an ad that had an `ad_reservation` contains a message indicating the ad credit was returned
  2. Reject email sent for an ad that had an `ad_featured_reservation` contains a message indicating the featured credit was returned
  3. Ban email sent for an ad that had an `ad_reservation` contains a message indicating the ad credit was returned
  4. Ban email sent for an ad that had an `ad_featured_reservation` contains a message indicating the featured credit was returned
  5. Reject/ban emails for ads with no reservations do not include any credit-return messaging (conditional rendering)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [ ] 17-01-PLAN.md — Update email templates and service layer with conditional credit-return messaging

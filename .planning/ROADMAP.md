<summary>✅ v1.1–v1.21 (Phases 3-52) — SHIPPED</summary>

All prior phases shipped. See `.planning/milestones/` for archived roadmaps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.22 — Checkout Flow UI (Phase 53) — SHIPPED 2026-03-08</summary>

- [x] **Phase 53: Checkout Page & Components** — `pages/pagar/index.vue` con auth middleware; `PaymentAd.vue` (preview aviso); `PaymentGateway.vue` (WebPay decorativo); `CheckoutDefault.vue` con lógica de pago completa; `FormCheckout.vue` reestructurado con títulos por sección, textos de contexto, `lang="ts"`, dead code eliminado; `BarCheckout.vue`; SCSS para `payment--ad` y `payment--gateway` (completed 2026-03-08)

</details>

### v1.23 — Unified Payment Flow

- [x] **Phase 55: Store Unification** — Eliminate `packs.store.ts`; pack data loaded directly in components that need it; all `packs.store` imports removed
- [ ] **Phase 56: Pack Purchase Flow** — `/packs` "Comprar" writes to `adStore` and navigates to `/pagar`; `/packs/comprar` page and `BuyPack.vue` removed
- [ ] **Phase 57: Payment Hub Adaptation** — `/pagar` handles pack-only (no `ad_id`) and pack+ad flows; `FormCheckout` hides reservation options in pack-only context

## Phase Details

### Phase 55: Store Unification
**Goal**: Pack data lives in `adStore` — `packs.store.ts` is gone and nothing misses it
**Depends on**: Phase 53 (checkout flow established)
**Requirements**: PAY-04, CLN-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `packs.store.ts` file does not exist in the codebase
  2. `packs/index.vue` loads pack data directly (e.g. via `useAsyncData` + Strapi call) without importing `packs.store`
  3. `PaymentMethod.vue` (inside `FormCheckout`) loads or receives pack data without importing `packs.store`
  4. `nuxt typecheck` passes with zero errors after store removal
**Plans**: 3 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 055-01-PLAN.md — Create usePacksList composable + migrate components and composables
- [ ] 055-02-PLAN.md — Migrate pages to direct Strapi calls
- [ ] 055-03-PLAN.md — Delete packs.store.ts and verify typecheck

### Phase 56: Pack Purchase Flow
**Goal**: Clicking "Comprar" on `/packs` takes the user directly to `/pagar` — no intermediate page
**Depends on**: Phase 55
**Requirements**: PACK-01, PACK-02, PACK-03, CLN-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User on `/packs` clicks "Comprar" on any pack and is immediately redirected to `/pagar`
  2. The selected pack is reflected in the checkout UI at `/pagar` (user sees what they're buying)
  3. `/packs/comprar` returns 404 — the route no longer exists
  4. `BuyPack.vue` file does not exist in the codebase
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 056-01-PLAN.md — Rewrite CardPack.vue to use adStore + delete comprar.vue/BuyPack.vue dead-code tree

### Phase 57: Payment Hub Adaptation
**Goal**: `/pagar` correctly processes payment whether or not an ad is associated — pack-only purchase works end-to-end
**Depends on**: Phase 56
**Requirements**: PAY-01, PAY-02, PAY-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User arriving at `/pagar` from `/packs` (no `adStore.ad.ad_id`) can complete a pack purchase successfully
  2. User arriving at `/pagar` from `resumen.vue` (with `adStore.ad.ad_id`) can complete an ad+pack purchase successfully (existing flow unbroken)
  3. `FormCheckout` does not show free/paid ad reservation options when `adStore.ad.ad_id` is absent
  4. Both payment paths (pack-only and pack+ad) call `publishAd()` only when an ad draft is present
**Plans**: TBD

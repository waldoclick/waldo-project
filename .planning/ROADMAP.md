## Active Phases

<!-- v1.19 Zoho CRM Sync Model — Phases 43-46 -->

- [x] **Phase 43: Zoho Service Reliability** — Fix token refresh (401 interceptor), fix auth header prefix, isolate tests with axios-mock-adapter, add env vars to .env.example (completed 2026-03-08)
  **Plans:** 2 plans
  - [ ] 43-01-PLAN.md — Fix ZohoHttpClient: correct auth header (`Zoho-oauthtoken`) and 401 response interceptor with `_retry` guard
  - [ ] 43-02-PLAN.md — Rewrite zoho.test.ts with axios-mock-adapter; add ZOHO_* vars to .env.example
- [x] **Phase 44: Zoho Service Layer** — Initialize Contact custom fields to 0 on creation; implement `updateContactStats()` and `createDeal()` on service; fix Lead_Status missing field (completed 2026-03-08)
  **Plans:** 2 plans
  - [ ] 44-01-PLAN.md — Fix createLead() (add Lead_Status) and createContact() (add zero-initialized counters) with TDD
  - [ ] 44-02-PLAN.md — Add ZohoDeal + IContactStats types; implement createDeal() and updateContactStats() with TDD
- [ ] **Phase 45: Payment Event Wiring** — Wire `pack_purchased` and `ad_paid` events to `createDeal()` + `updateContactStats()`; resolve Contact ID via `findContact()` before every deal creation
- [ ] **Phase 46: Ad Published Event Wiring** — Wire `ad_published` event to `updateContactStats()`; guard with status-transition check to prevent double-counting

## Phase Details

### Phase 43: Zoho Service Reliability
**Goal**: The Zoho HTTP client handles token expiry correctly and tests never hit the live API
**Depends on**: Nothing (foundation phase)
**Requirements**: RELY-01, RELY-02, RELY-04, RELY-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A Zoho API call made after token expiry (simulated 401 response) automatically refreshes the token and retries — the calling code receives the successful result, not an error
  2. The authorization header on every outbound Zoho request reads `Zoho-oauthtoken <token>` (not `Bearer <token>`)
  3. Running `yarn test` in `apps/strapi` makes zero network calls to `zohoapis.com` — all Zoho HTTP calls are intercepted by `axios-mock-adapter`
  4. `apps/strapi/.env.example` contains all four `ZOHO_*` variables (`ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `ZOHO_API_URL`)
**Plans**: 2 plans — 43-01-PLAN.md (ZohoHttpClient fix), 43-02-PLAN.md (test isolation + .env.example)

### Phase 44: Zoho Service Layer
**Goal**: The Zoho service exposes `createDeal()` and `updateContactStats()`, Contact creation initializes counters to zero, and Leads are created with a status
**Depends on**: Phase 43
**Requirements**: CONT-01, CONT-02, DEAL-01, RELY-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A Contact created via `createContact()` always has `Ads_Published__c: 0`, `Total_Spent__c: 0`, and `Packs_Purchased__c: 0` in the Zoho API payload
  2. `zohoService.createDeal(deal)` posts a Deal payload with `Deal_Name`, `Stage: "Closed Won"`, `Amount`, `Contact_Name: { id }`, `Type`, `Closing_Date`, `Description`, and `Lead_Source` — and returns the created Deal's Zoho ID
  3. `zohoService.updateContactStats(contactId, stats)` issues a `PUT /crm/v5/Contacts/{id}` with only the provided stat fields (no undefined keys sent)
  4. `zohoService.createLead()` includes `Lead_Status: "New"` in the payload sent to Zoho
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 45: Payment Event Wiring
**Goal**: Every confirmed pack purchase and paid ad activation creates a Deal in Zoho and updates the Contact's spend stats
**Depends on**: Phase 44
**Requirements**: DEAL-02, DEAL-03, EVT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After Transbank confirms a pack payment (`pack_purchased`), a Deal appears in Zoho linked to the buyer's Contact, with `Amount` matching the charged amount and `Stage: "Closed Won"`
  2. After Transbank confirms an ad payment (`ad_paid`), a Deal appears in Zoho linked to the buyer's Contact, with `Amount` matching the charged amount
  3. The `Total_Spent__c` field on the Zoho Contact is incremented by the payment amount after each confirmed payment event
  4. `Packs_Purchased__c` is incremented on the Contact after a pack purchase (but not after an ad payment)
  5. If `findContact(email)` returns null (user not yet in Zoho), no Deal is created and no error is thrown — the failure is logged and the payment flow completes normally
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 46: Ad Published Event Wiring
**Goal**: Every ad approval increments the Contact's published-ads counter in Zoho, firing exactly once per genuine first-publish transition
**Depends on**: Phase 44
**Requirements**: EVT-01, EVT-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When an admin approves an ad (`approveAd()` called), the Zoho Contact for that user has `Ads_Published__c` incremented by 1 and `Last_Ad_Posted_At__c` updated to the current timestamp
  2. The sync only fires when the ad's status transitions to `"published"` for the first time — re-approving an already-published ad does not increment the counter a second time
  3. No Deal is created for the `ad_published` event (only Contact stats are updated)
  4. If `findContact(email)` returns null for the ad's owner, the sync is silently skipped and `approveAd()` completes successfully
**Plans**: TBD

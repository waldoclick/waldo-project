## Phases

### 🚧 v1.45 User Onboarding (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Force newly registered users with incomplete profiles through a dedicated onboarding flow before they can use the platform.

- [x] **Phase 099: Onboarding UI** - Layout, pages, and components for the onboarding flow (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] **Phase 100: Guard** - Middleware that intercepts navigation and enforces profile completion (completed 2026-03-19)
- [ ] **Phase 101: Integration** - Wire One Tap suppression, referer exclusion, and pre-redirect URL storage

## Phase Details

### Phase 099: Onboarding UI
**Goal**: Users can complete their profile through a dedicated onboarding page and reach a confirmation screen with clear next steps
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone)
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03, FORM-01, FORM-02, FORM-03, THANK-01, THANK-02, THANK-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User navigating to `/onboarding` sees only the Waldo logo with no header, footer, or navigation — just the profile form
  2. User can complete the profile form at `/onboarding` and be taken to `/onboarding/thankyou` on success
  3. Existing profile editing at `/cuenta/perfil/editar` continues to work exactly as before
  4. `/onboarding/thankyou` displays a thank-you message with two buttons: "Crear mi primer anuncio" and "Volver a Waldo"
**Plans:** 3/3 plans complete
Plans:
- [x] 099-00-PLAN.md — Wave 0 test stubs (Nyquist scaffolding)
- [x] 099-01-PLAN.md — Layout, SCSS, and FormProfile emit refactor (foundation)
- [x] 099-02-PLAN.md — Onboarding pages and components (user-facing UI)

### Phase 100: Guard
**Goal**: Incomplete-profile users are automatically intercepted and routed to onboarding on every page navigation
**Depends on**: Phase 099
**Requirements**: GUARD-01, GUARD-02, GUARD-03, GUARD-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A newly registered user visiting any non-exempt page is redirected to `/onboarding` before seeing any content
  2. A user with a complete profile visiting `/onboarding` is redirected to the home page
  3. Visiting `/login`, `/registro`, or `/logout` never triggers the onboarding redirect
  4. Page refresh on any page does not cause an incorrect redirect to `/onboarding` (SSR-safe)
**Plans:** 1/1 plans complete
Plans:
- [ ] 100-01-PLAN.md — Onboarding guard middleware with TDD and meStore cache fix

### Phase 101: Integration
**Goal**: Google One Tap is suppressed on onboarding pages, the referer is saved before redirect, and `/onboarding` routes are excluded from referer history
**Depends on**: Phase 100
**Requirements**: INTEG-01, INTEG-02, INTEG-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Google One Tap overlay does not appear on `/onboarding` or `/onboarding/thankyou`
  2. "Volver a Waldo" on the thank-you page returns the user to the page they were visiting before being redirected to onboarding
  3. Navigating through `/onboarding` pages does not pollute `appStore.referer` with onboarding URLs
**Plans:** 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 101-01-PLAN.md — One Tap suppression, referer exclusion, and INTEG-03 verification

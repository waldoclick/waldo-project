# Codacy

- Codacy is configured at the root level (`.codacy.yaml`) and analyzes all apps (dashboard, website, strapi) from a single configuration
- The Codacy configuration supports JavaScript, TypeScript, and Vue across all apps
- Enabled engines: eslint, stylelint, duplication detection, and complexity analysis
- To run Codacy analysis, use: `yarn codacy` from the root directory
- Codacy runs through Turbo, which executes the codacy task across all apps
- Build outputs, dependencies, and test files are automatically excluded from analysis
- Do not create individual `.codacy.yaml` files in apps - use only the root configuration
- When making changes that affect code quality, ensure they pass Codacy's analysis before committing
- Codacy analyzes code duplication, complexity, and follows ESLint and Stylelint rules configured in the project
